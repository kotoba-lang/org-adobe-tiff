;; `kotoba/tiff/header.kotoba` against `tiff.core/parse`.
;;
;; Parity covers what the library does read: the byte order of a real file,
;; and where IFD0 sits. The fixtures are the repo's own `.tif` files —
;; written by Pillow and by a real encoder, not by this test — so agreement
;; is against something neither side made up.
;;
;; The REFUSALS have no oracle, because `parse` does not make them. Measured
;; on this repo at e721594:
;;
;;   [0x58 0x59 …] ("XY")   -> {:byte-order :little}
;;   [0x49 0x49 99 0 …]     -> {:byte-order :little}
;;
;; The first is not a TIFF and is read as a little-endian one; the second has
;; magic 99 where §2 requires 42, and nothing reads that field. The repo's
;; tests build only `II`+42 and `MM`+42 headers, so neither gap has anything
;; looking at it. Those cases are asserted directly against the guest and
;; against the recorded behaviour of the oracle, so the difference is visible
;; rather than implied.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph). It did not grow a second copy of the refusals.
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;;   * `only-II-and-MM-are-byte-order-markers` — falling through to
;;     little-endian is how a file that is not a TIFF becomes one;
;;   * `the-magic-number-is-checked` — §2's whole purpose, and the cheapest
;;     check in the format;
;;   * `an-ifd-inside-the-header-is-refused` — an IFD overlapping the
;;     8-byte header is not a smaller image;
;;   * `an-entry-count-that-does-not-fit-is-refused` — refused BEFORE the
;;     host reads a byte, because reading first and discovering later is the
;;     out-of-range read.
